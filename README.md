# brainscrewed-A BrainFluck Interpreter
A simple Brainfluck interpreter implemented in two different ways.  <br/>

<strong>Implementation </strong>  <br/>
(1) Direct Interpreter  <i>(/master/first-hand-interpretation)</i>   <br/>
(2) Bytecode Interpreter  <i>(dev in progress)</i>              <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>(1) Direct Interpretation  </strong>   <br/>
Implementation of brainfluck in direct interpretation method, In which scripts are executed   <br/>
with their native language, and not converted to any intermediate representation!  <br/>
For e.g. Lisp, Scheme, etc!   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>(2) Bytecode Interpretation   </strong><br/>
Implementation of brainfluck in which scripts are converted    <br/>
to an intermediate language-representation and then executed    <br/>
by dedicated VM(Virtual Machine)!     <br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm implementating interpreter    <br/>
in two distinct ways, for learning purposes!    <br/>
And also b'cuz Brainfluck is easy to implement!     </i><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Usage:</strong> <br/>
<pre>
    ~$ python first-hand-interpretation/brainf.py source.bf
    ~$ python middle-man-interpretation/brainf.py source.bf
    
</pre>

I'd Love to hear <b>edits, suggestions, and your   <br/>
contribution</b>.  <br/>
